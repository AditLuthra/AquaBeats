## 🔊 What is AquaBeats?

AquaBeats is a sound-reactive fountain that syncs water jets to the rhythm of music. Whether it's EDM, classical, or lo-fi beats — the water dances to your soundtrack.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Captures live audio using microphone or AUX input
- Applies Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to detect frequency bands
- Activates submersible pumps via MOSFETs using Arduino PWM
- Result: Real-time synchronized water choreography

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Arduino UNO / Nano**
- **IRF540N / IRLZ44N MOSFETs**
- **Submersible DC water pumps**
- **Audio input (AUX/mic preamp)**
- **MATLAB for simulation & testing**
